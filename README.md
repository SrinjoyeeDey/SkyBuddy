   <b>SkyBuddy</b> is my first ever <span style="color:#3178c6;font-weight:bold;">TypeScript</span> project—a beautiful, lightning-fast, and feature-rich weather dashboard. <br>

## 🌟 Why This Project is Special to Me

This is my very first hands-on project using <b>TypeScript</b>. I started with zero prior experience in TypeScript, and SkyBuddy is the result of my curiosity, persistence, and love for learning new technologies. Every feature, every bug fix, and every animation is a step in my journey as a developer. I truly appreciate the learning phase—it's where the magic happens!
